Study Title	"The genome of the medicinal plant Macleaya cordata provides new insights into benzylisoquinoline alkaloids metabolism"
Study Description	"The genome of the medicinal plant Macleaya cordata provides new insights into benzylisoquinoline alkaloids metabolism. Overuse of antibiotics in animal agriculture and medicine has caused a series of potential threats to public health. Macleaya cordata, a medicinal plant species from the Papaveraceae family and a safe resource for the manufacture of feed addictive for livestock, contains high amount of anti-microbial benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs) including sanguinarine (SAN) and chelerythrine (CHE). Here, we de novo sequenced M. cordata, the first plant genome from Papaveraceae family, and applied integrated multiple strategies to systematically investigate the BIAs metabolism in this plant, which uncovered a conserved but slightly different SAN and CHE biosynthetic pathway in M. cordata. Detailed profiles of the intermediates as well as the end-products also suggest the potential regulator and transporter involved in the SAN and CHE metabolism in this plant. The interdisciplinary platform and a global view of the BIAs metabolism obtained from M. cordata may pave the way to accelerate the shift of BIAs production from plant to scalable and flexible microbial source."

Study Protocol Description	"M. cordata regenerated plantlets was grown in an MS medium for 60 days (plant height: 10-12 cm).  Four ml of isotopically labeled [ring-13C6]-tyrosine (0.4 mg/ml) was added to the medium in a plastic bottle which had one regenerated plantlets, and non-labeled tyrosine was added as a control. Three biological replicates of one regenerated plantlet were performed. The plastic bottles (diameter: 4 cm, height: 15 cm) were closed and exposed to constant illumination at 2000 lux (warm white fluorescent lamps) at 26 °C. Three biological replicates of a regenerated plantlet (3 plantlets in total) were harvested six days later and metabolites were isolated as described in Extraction protocol.  The fresh roots, leaves, stems of regenerated plantlets were ground to fine powder in liquid nitrogen and freeze drying was used to obtain the dried plant material. "	"Potential metabolites were isolated from 25 mg of dried plant material in 12.5 ml methanol using an ultrasonic extraction procedure at room temperature for 30 minutes. After filtration through a 0.22 μm membrane filter (PALL, USA), the solution was analyzed using LC-Q/TOF MS."	"Chromatographic separation was performed on an ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC, 1290, Agilent, USA) using an X-aqua C18 column (2.1×150 mm, 5 μm, Acchrom, China). The mobile phase consisted of a 0.1% formic acid aqueous solution (v/v, solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid acetonitrile (v/v, solvent B). The flow rate was 0.3 mL/min, and the injection volume was 1 μl. The gradient was set as follows: 0-1 min, a linear gradient of 5-10% B; 1-6 min, a linear gradient to 30% B; 6-7 min, a linear gradient to 38% B; 7-9 min, an isocratic of 38% B; 9-15 min, a linear gradient to 60% B; 15-25 min, a linear gradient to 75% B; 25.1 -30 min, an isocratic elution of 95% B; 35.1 -35 min, an isocratic elution of 5% B. The automatic sampler temperature was set at room temperature."	"UHPLC was coupled with Q/TOF MS (6530A, Agilent, USA). Data acquisition was performed in positive ionization and full scan modes (m/z: 100 - 1000). Spray parameters were set as follows: Gas temperature, 350 °C; Gas flow, 11 l/min; Nebulizer, 32 psi; Sheath gas temperature, 350 °C; Sheath gas flow, 10 l/min; Vcap voltage, 4,000 V; Nozzle voltage, 500 V; Fragment voltage, 135 V. The other settings varied depending on tuning. Purine (C5H4N4, m/z: 121.0508, Agilent, USA) and HP-0921 (C18H18O6N3P3F24, m/z: 922.0097, Agilent, USA) were used for mass calibration. "	"Centroid LC-Q/TOF MS data were processed using Agilent MassHunter Qualitative Analysis software (B.05.00).  Raw data files (.d format) were converted to mzData format. "	"Monoisotopic masses of the protonated molecular ions [M+H]+ were calculated using the data explorer software of the Q/TOF instrument.  Identification of alkaloids was accomplished using retention times (RTs) and exact mass (<5 ppm.) of the monoisotopic mass of the protonated molecular ion [M+H]+ or radical molecular ion [M]+. Authentic standards were used to confirm the identity of the intermediates.
</p>
The [ring-13C6]-labeled various mass peaks were extracted from the total ion chromatogram by adding the exact mass of 6.02013 ([M+H+6.02013]+). These labeled target compounds were confirmed by comparing their retention times (RTs) and exact mass in MS spectra with their unlabeled authentic standards. "

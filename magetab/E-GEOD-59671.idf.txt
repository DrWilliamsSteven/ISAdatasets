Investigation Title	Celecoxib, rofecoxib treated human smooth muscle cells microarray timecourse						
Comment[Submitted Name]	Celecoxib, rofecoxib treated human smooth muscle cells microarray timecourse
Experiment Description	The aim of this data set is to measure the effect of rofecoxib and celecoxib on the transcription profile in an in vitro inflammation model. Transcription profiling was carried out using Affymetrix HG U-133A v2 microarrays. Human aortic smooth muscle cells (3F1243) were pre-treated with rofecoxib (500 nM) or celecoxib (500 nM) for two hours and subsequently exposed to IL-1beta (10 ng/ml). Transcription profiling was carried out at several time points of IL-1beta exposure: Four samples at -2 hours. Four samples each of control, celecoxib, and rofecoxib at each time point 0hr, 2hr, 8hr and 24hr. 52 samples in total.

Protocol Description	Expression values were generated using RMA as implemented in the Affymetrix Expression Console software. ID_REF =  VALUE = Log2 RMA signal calculated by Affymetrix Expression Console software	Labeling was carried out at the Penn Microarray Facility.	Hybridization was carried out at the Penn Microarray Facility. Affymetrix Human Genome U133A v2 was used.	Cells were incubated with rofecoxib (500 nM), celecoxib (500 nM) or DMSO for 2 hours. Subsequently, cells were stimulated with interleukin 1beta (10 ng/mL). The start of incubation with interleukin 1beta is taken to be time zero.	Primary human aortic smooth muscle cells (3F1243) from Lonza were cultured using standard cell culture. Cells were harvested from culture after 0, 2, 8, or 24 hours incubation with interleukin 1beta (10 ng/mL).	Qiagen kit was used to isolate total RNA.	Data were collected at the Penn Microarray Facility.

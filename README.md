## Master branch

In the master branch, we keep example ISA datasets, which may be available in different formats (tab, RDF, JSON)

Other ISA datasets are available:

1. from EMBL-EBI Metabolights

1. from NPG Scientific Data: https://github.com/ScientificDataLabs/ISA-tab

## Tests branch

The tests branch contains datasets in ISA, and other formats, used for testing in the ISA-API (https://github.com/ISA-tools/isa-api).
